## Overview

Color Clicker is a small interactive web application built with **React** that allows users to click colored squares to generate random colors. Each clicked color is logged and displayed with its corresponding hex value. The app demonstrates proficiency in **React state management, component design, and front-end UI layout**.

## Learning Outcomes

Building this project helped me strengthen my skills in:  

1. **React Fundamentals** – Components, props, state, and event handling.  
2. **Front-End Layout** – Using CSS flexbox to center content and align elements.  
3. **Dynamic UI Updates** – Real-time color changes and logging.  
4. **Problem Solving** – Handling layout bugs, off-center elements, and dynamic data.  
5. **Project Structuring** – Creating modular, reusable components (`ColorBox`) and maintaining clean code.
